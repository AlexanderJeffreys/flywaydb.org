# Clean

Drops all objects in the configured schemas.

![Clean](/assets/balsamiq/command-clean.png)

Clean is a great help in development and test. It will effectively give you a fresh start, by wiping your configured
    schemas completely clean. All objects (tables, views, procedures, ...) will be dropped.

Needless to say: **do not use against your production DB!**
